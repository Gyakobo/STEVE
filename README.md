This project was done in association with the Solar-Terrestrial Research Department(CSTR) in the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and was purposely crafted to find the phenomenon *STEVE*.

>**The Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement** (STEVE) is a type 
of phenomenon that appears as a night-time mauve emission, equatorward of the auroral oval, during strong plasma flows. They extend thousands of kilometers in the east-west direction and only tens of kilometers in the north-south direction.



The following project was also utilized to develop the following graphs in preparation for the CEDAR workshop in 2023 in San Diego, CA.
